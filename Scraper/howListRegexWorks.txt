This is what an element in the list looks like:

|-
| {{SMS|Árpád||2}}
| 1901-09-11{{sfn|Gardiner|Chesneau|Kolesnik|1979|p=272}} 
| {{sclass|Habsburg|battleship|4}}
| [[Pre-dreadnought]]
| {{navy|Austria-Hungary}}
| Awarded to UK 1920, scrapped 1921{{sfn|Gardiner|Chesneau|Kolesnik|1979|p=272}}

Essentially we have

|-
| {{Name, and disambiguation}}
| Date launched in yyyy-mm-dd maybe with a source
| {{sclass|class name|battleship| number}}
| type, according to wikipedia
| {{navy|whoever owns this}}
| Some comment, may or may not be there

Maybe there will be newlines, maybe the different columns are seperated by ||, or a newline and a single | like this,
maybe there will be any number of spaces,
oh and there might be some random information here, and here (comment and source) we don't care about


To find the start, we use a look-behind for the vertical line, the minus, and newline. So we don't want that, we just want the thing after it

(?<=\|-\n)

the \n means new-line by the way, and \| is just | because | means something special in regex, the next thing is 

\|.*?({{.*?}}).*?

This looks for and saves the ship name, first we look for | and .*? is any number of characters, in our case spacess,
everything in () is something we want to save
and {{.*?}} just means anything in two {{}}, so this finds and saves this part

[\|\||\n]

Is in a lot of places, and it means EITHER || OR a newline, which is one of the two ways different columns can be seperated



.*?(\d+-\d+-\d+).*?

Well, then we capture and save any number of digits, that is what \d+ means, a minus, any number of digits, another minus, and any number of digits

That essentially could be a year, month, day like 1904-04-03

Then a .*? captures and doesn't save everything until the next column:

[\|\||\n]



Then we capture everything to do with the class:
(.*?)
[\|\||\n\|]


I don't know why I included  that \| only here; it is everywhere and usually this .*? just matches and ignores this

Capture the type inside [[]] (I don't actually use this for anything but I still save it
.*?
\[\[(.*?)\]\]

Got to the next line
.*?
[\|\||\n]

Finally we capture and save every information about the navy

.*?
({{.*?}})

So this is how this line of regex works
