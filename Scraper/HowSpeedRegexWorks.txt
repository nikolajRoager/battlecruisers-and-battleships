Now, first thing first, the line with power starts with either a star * or an = and then some spaces

[\*=].*?


by the way, anything inside square brackets means either one of these

Then we have the word convert, or cvt, here seperated by a | without a slash, this inside a () means either convert, or cvt

{{(convert|cvt)\|

Now, the number can either be written as

 2,000|to|2,500
 
 or maybe 2,000-2,500
 
 or just 2,000
 
 In any case, we want the lower bound, we again use a | to get one out of three option like this

((?<number1>\d+(,\d+)?)\|to\|\d+(,\d+)|
(?<number2>\d+(,\d+)?)-\d+(,\d+)|
(?<number3>\d+(,\d+)?))

Essentially, the last case match 2,000| or 2000, the middle match 2,000-2,500, the first match 2,000|to|2500

By the way, the ?<name> gives a name to the thing so we can easily find it again

Finally, we want to get the unit this is converted from, we search  for one of these units:

\|(?<from>shp|ihp|kW|PS)

PS means horsepower, because of course it does

shp stands for shaft horsepower, ihp is indicated horsepower, and I assume the others are indicated as well

Im going to be honest, I am not sure whether shp or ihp is metric or imperial horsepower, and i doubt the people who wrote the article knows.
