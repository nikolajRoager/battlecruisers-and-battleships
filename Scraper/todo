Later errors with data analysis
=============
All data has been collected, but there are plenty of errors due to my bot misunderstanding human errors on wikipedia.

For example, Fast battleship USS New Jersey has power indicated as 4 x 53000 hp turbines, my script reads that as 53000 indicated horsepower, resulting in pre-dreadnought power to weight ratio.

Other errors are noted with USS Pennsylvania and Florida, which return wrong displacement (fuel weight is incorrectly read as entire weight), it is necessary to manually delete these errors

Errors are more likely with US ships, as Americans are sloppy when it comes to formatting, and are incapable of using civilized units of measurement.

It is necessary to plot all data, plot horsepower to tonnes as a function of year and examine obvious outliers

plot horsepower to tonnes as a function of speed and examine obvious outliers
